                This holiday season, give the gift of kindness and support to women in need. I'm Jarrod Shaw, one of the cofounders and Chief Financial Officer for RedDrop, a feminine hygiene company that makes products for tweens and teenagers. Most of us are fortunate to spend the holidays with our loved ones in the safety and comfort of our own homes, but many women will be spending the holidays in a shelter for the safety of themselves and their children, or perhaps even homeless. To ensure these women have a special holiday, please open your hearts to donate to this worthy cause.
